# GPX Track Visualizer

This small program visualizes `.gpx` files. Tracks from multiple files can be animated simultaneously or sequentially. The sequential animation order can be changed after file upload using drag and drop.

The animation uses the leaflet plugin [SnakeAnim](https://github.com/IvanSanchez/Leaflet.Polyline.SnakeAnim) by [Iván Sánchez Ortega](https://github.com/IvanSanchez).

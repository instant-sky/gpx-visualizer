# GPX Track Visualizer

This small program visualizes `.gpx` files (in this case for railway routes). Tracks from multiple files can be animated simultaneously or sequentially. The sequential animation order can be changed after file upload using drag and drop.

The [BRouter](https://brouter.de/) website is a good place to start for creating GPX tracks.

Try it yourself here: [gpx-visualizer](https://instant-sky-gpx-visualizer.netlify.app/).

The animation uses the leaflet plugin [SnakeAnim](https://github.com/IvanSanchez/Leaflet.Polyline.SnakeAnim) by [Iván Sánchez Ortega](https://github.com/IvanSanchez).
